#Example1:
#   Enter the current temperature outside: 40
#   Would you like to convert to Celsius? (Y/N): Y
#   The temperature is 4.444444 degrees Celsius
#
#Example2:
#   Enter the current temperature outside: 27
#   Would you like to convert to Celsius? (Y/N): Y
#   The temperature is -2.77777 degrees Celsius
#
#Example3:
#   Enter the current temperature outside: 35
#   Would you like to convert to Celsius? (Y/N): N
#   The temperature is 35 degrees Fahrenheit



# HINT, you will need this: ((current_temp) − 32) × 5/9 = 0°C
